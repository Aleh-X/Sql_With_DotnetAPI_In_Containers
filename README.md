# Sql_With_DotnetAPI_In_Containers
This is an example of how to run .net API application and sql server in docker containers and make API app make request to database.
In this solution I use docker-compose to deploy into docker host Api container and sql azure-sql-edge server.
This solution should work on mac and windows.
